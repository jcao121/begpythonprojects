# My name is Johnson Cao I am an aspiring Software Engineer focused on learning Python and this repo is where my first projects will be.

# Things I’ve learned from projects

# - Rock Paper Scissors - can use a list to check if user input is either rock paper or scissors can use “continue” to start loop all over if user does not input rock paper or scissors, used too many if statements can just list all the winning options for player1 and put else as comp wins

# - Guessing game - needed to change input to int I couldn't figure out why it keep looping, was looping because input was a string "4" vs 4

# - Adventure game - needed to use nested while loop instead of continue, because continue started it from the top but I wanted it to repeat one question if they added the wrong input, learned about .capitialize() to cap first letter, learning more about break and continue, learning about sleep to make it seem like a dialogue, ran into a bug where smaug hp was exactly 0 and it would start over, that was because I did not use >= and only >, this project really taught me more about if statement and while statements and using nested while loops with conditional statements, had to assign smaug hp to = +0 if he dies so it doesnt become a negative int
