# My name is Johnson Cao I am an aspiring Software Engineer focused on learning Python and this repo is where my first projects will be.

# Things I’ve learned from projects

# - Rock Paper Scissors - can use a list to check if user input is either rock paper or scissors can use “continue” to start loop all over if user does not input rock paper or scissors, used too many if statements can just list all the winning options for player1 and put else as comp wins

# - Guessing game - needed to change input to int I couldn't figure out why it keep looping, was looping because input was a string "4" vs 4

# - Adventure game - needed to use nested while loop instead of continue, because continue started it from the top but I wanted it to repeat one question if they added the wrong input
